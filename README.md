Academic & Club Scheduler (Flask App)
This project is a Flask-based web application designed to automate the scheduling of academic timetables and club events. It allows users to input customizable parameters such as number of subjects, faculties, event durations, clubs, venues, and working days. The system intelligently allocates time slots, ensuring balanced distribution, avoiding overlaps, and inserting breaks when needed. It also supports PDF export of the final schedules.

Key features:

1. Academic timetable generation with support for theory, lab, and tutorial sessions
2. Club event scheduler with multiple venues and time slots
3. Conflict-free scheduling logic with optional breaks
4. User-friendly web interface using HTML and Flask
5. PDF generation of final timetables using ReportLab
